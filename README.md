# Week-1 Task

## Overview
This folder contains the deliverables for Week-1 of the Techplement project. Below is a summary of what has been done:

### Task Highlights:

In this task, I deployed a WordPress application on AWS using both monolithic and microservices architectures. For the monolithic setup, I launched an EC2 instance, installed Apache, PHP, and MySQL, and configured them to run correctly. I secured MySQL, created a database, and adjusted file permissions. I configured security groups for HTTP and HTTPS access and completed the WordPress setup through the public IP. In the microservices setup, I deployed MySQL and WordPress on separate EC2 instances, ensuring proper communication by configuring security groups and updating the WordPress configuration to connect to the remote database. This process gave me hands-on experience in deploying WordPress, managing services, configuring security, and enabling inter-service communication on AWS.
