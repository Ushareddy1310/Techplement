In this project, I learned how to deploy a WordPress application on AWS using a monolithic architecture. First, I launched an EC2 instance and connected to it via SSH. I then installed Apache, PHP, and MySQL using the yum package manager, setting up the necessary environment for WordPress. I started Apache and MySQL services, ensuring they automatically run at system boot. I also secured MySQL, created a WordPress database, and set up a user with appropriate privileges. After downloading and installing WordPress, I configured file permissions and ownership for proper operation. To make the site accessible, I configured the EC2 security groups to allow HTTP and HTTPS traffic. Finally, I accessed the WordPress setup wizard through the instance's public IP to complete the installation. Through this process, I gained hands-on experience in deploying WordPress on AWS, managing the required services, configuring security, and enabling external access to the application.
